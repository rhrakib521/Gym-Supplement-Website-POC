## 1. Project snapshot

**What:** A full front-end rebuild of thryvebd.com — from a one-product brochure into a
premium bilingual ecommerce platform for a Bangladeshi creatine brand.

**Why:** The current site is a brochure (no account, no tracking, no upsell, no payments,
single product, hardcoded testimonials). The brand wants to sit beside **MuscleBlaze**, not
read as a cheap local copy.

**For whom:** Bangladeshi gym-goers (18–35), COD-dominant market, WhatsApp-first
communication, growing trust in lab-tested local supplements. Bilingual EN / বাংলা.

**Scope of THIS effort (decided):** Premium front-end build across the full experience,
**with a clean mock-data / API-adapter layer** so it drops onto the separate "Thryve OS"
back-end later. **No live payments or back-end wiring yet.** The back-end (Node/Express +
PostgreSQL + 14 AI agents + 12 lifecycle flows + Nuport/AiSensy/SSLCommerz/bKash/Nagad) is
being built by another team (brief Vol 6–10).

**Success looks like:** A design-forward, fast, accessible, bilingual site that feels premium
and unmistakably Bangladeshi, with every key ecommerce flow working client-side and a data
layer one step away from the real API.

## 2. Inputs & references

**The brief** (`Thryve_Website_FrontEnd_Brief.pdf`) specifies in detail:
- 5 categories: **Creatine** (live), **Accessories** (live), **Pre-Workout "Katana"** (Aug '26),
  **Activewear** (new brand, soon), **Whey** (2027). Coming-soon items → teaser/waitlist pages.
- ~20 page types (full sitemap in §6).
- Bilingual EN+বাংলা; payments COD (default) → bKash → Nagad → SSLCommerz/cards.
- Lead capture: WhatsApp sticky bar + exit-intent phone popup. Upsell at PDP, cart, checkout, post-purchase.
- **Trust moat:** QR authenticity verification + lab certificates.
- Design system: dark-first (`#0D1117` / accent `#1D9E75`), light mode; Inter (EN) + Hind
  Siliguri (BN); full color/component tokens.
- Tech: Next.js + Tailwind + react-i18next, SSR/SEO, on Thryve OS back-end.

**Brief's named inspirations (what to take):**
- **MuscleBlaze** — goal-based nav, authenticity checker, product-page structure + upsell logic (closest reference).
- **BeastLife** — nav-level authenticity, category image tiles on homepage (exactly Thryve's need).
- **SuperYou** — identity-led "become someone" aspirational tone + whitespace (closest to Thryve's pivot). ← **We chose this lane.**
- **Optimum Nutrition India** — lab results prominence; product tabs (About / Ingredients / How To Use / Reviews / Certificate).

## 3. Research findings (2026-06-16)

**2026 premium-supplement/wellness web signals:**
- **Trust-first > merely minimal.** Earning trust quickly beats clean-but-cold aesthetics.
- **Clean-label transparency + lab credibility shown prominently** drives conversion.
- **Immersive scroll storytelling + bold, ownable identity** separates premium from "generic supplement SaaS."
- Dark athletic aesthetics are on-trend; performance (LCP, Lighthouse 90+) is a brand signal.
- Sources: [premium wellness design trends](https://www.merokeeventures.com/blog/website-design-trends-premium-health-wellness-brands-2026/), [immersive storytelling guide](https://www.utsubo.com/blog/immersive-storytelling-websites-guide), [Dribbble supplement work](https://dribbble.com/search/supplement-landing-page).

**Implication for Thryve:** lead with calm aspirational identity + make the trust moat (lab-tested,
QR-authentic, GMP, "Made in Bangladesh") genuinely visible — not buried. Editorial restraint reads
"expensive"; hype reads "cheap local copy." → validates the **Refined & Editorial** direction.

## 4. Decision log

| Date | # | Decision | Rationale | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-16 | D1 | Build target = **premium front-end + mock-data layer** (no live back-end) | Delivers the design/storytelling win now; back-end owned by another team; clean adapter makes later integration trivial | ✅ |
| 2026-06-16 | D2 | Design personality = **Refined & Editorial** (SuperYou-leaning) | Dark but airy, aspirational, identity-led, generous whitespace. Reads premium, ages well, matches brief's "Level 2 aspirational pivot." Avoids loud-hype generic look | ✅ |
| 2026-06-16 | D3 | Bangla = **EN-first, full i18n architecture, Bangla on key surfaces** | Ships correct architecture now (no painful retrofit); high-traffic surfaces bilingual; marketing/blog prose EN for now, BN later | ✅ |
| 2026-06-16 | D4 | Stack = **Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + react-i18next + Framer Motion + Zustand** | Matches brief; SSR/SEO for product/blog; refined motion; lightweight cart state | ✅ |
| 2026-06-16 | D5 | Data = **typed mock-data module + `lib/api.ts` adapter** mirroring Thryve OS endpoints (`/api/products`, `/api/orders`, `/api/track`, `/api/verify/[serial]`) | Swap mock→real fetch later by editing one layer; no hardcoded content scattered in components | ✅ |
| 2026-06-16 | D6 | Type pairing = **Space Grotesk (display) + Inter (body) + Hind Siliguri (BN)**, optional **Fraunces** serif for aspirational pull-quotes | Grotesk+serif+clean-body reads editorial-premium and dodges the generic "Inter everywhere" AI look; all on Google Fonts (clean `next/font`) | ✅ |
| 2026-06-16 | D7 | Imagery = **premium stock (athletes/lifestyle) + CSS/SVG creatine-jar mockup**; client drops real assets later | No client photos available now; keep `next/image` + Cloudinary-ready paths so real assets slot in | ✅ |
| 2026-06-16 | D8 | Content store = **mock data now, CMS-ready structure** (no Sanity this pass) | Brief recommends headless CMS but that's premature for a front-end POC; structure so a CMS swap is localised | ✅ |
| 2026-06-24 | R1 | **Redesign scope** = full visual overhaul across all ~33 pages | Client likes BeastLife design → wants a full blend, not a homepage patch | ✅ |
| 2026-06-24 | R2 | **Blend direction** = *Premium commerce blend* (BeastLife structure/energy, executed premium; strict badge discipline) | BeastLife's actual look is discount-dense; cloning it regresses to the "cheap local copy" the brief warns against. Take the structure + energy, execute premium | ✅ |
| 2026-06-24 | R3 | **Story features** = Brand-origin narrative + Product/trust journey + Goal-based journey (+ transformation strip feeding `/stories`) | Client asked for "a bit story-based features"; these 3 differentiate the brand and elevate the trust moat + identity | ✅ |
| 2026-06-24 | R4 | **Execution strategy** = Foundation + Home first, then propagate (phased R0–R5) | Proves the whole new system end-to-end on the flagship homepage before touching the other 32 pages; lowest risk | ✅ |
| 2026-06-24 | R5 | **New design personality** = "Performance Editorial" | Fuses BeastLife commerce energy/structure with Thryve editorial restraint + Bangla pride (see new spec) | ✅ |
| 2026-06-24 | R6 | **No mascot** | Identity = T-mark + wordmark + Bangla pride; not an animal character (rejected BeastLife's panther) | ✅ |

## 5. Design specification — "Refined Editorial"

### 5.1 Positioning & voice
- **Core line:** "become unstoppable." Identity-led: the brand is about *becoming*, not just buying.
- **Twin feelings (per brief):** raw performance energy **+** Bangladeshi pride. We express pride as
  *proof* — "Made in Bangladesh," real local athletes, Bangla as a first-class language — never as decoration.
- **Tone:** calm, confident, aspirational, precise. **Not** shouty, not hype-stacked, not neon.
- **Trust is a feature, shown visibly:** Lab-Tested · QR-Authenticated · GMP · 3rd-party tested.

### 5.2 Color (extends brief tokens; refined for editorial depth)
| Token | Dark | Light | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#0B0F13` | `#FFFFFF` | page |
| `--surface-1` | `#12161B` | `#F3F8F5` | cards |
| `--surface-2` | `#1A1F26` | `#E8F0ED` | raised/hover |
| `--line` | `#222831` | `#E0E0E0` | borders/dividers |
| `--ink` | `#F2F5F7` | `#0A0A14` | headings/prices |
| `--ink-dim` | `#9AA3AD` | `#5A5A72` | secondary text |
| `--green` | `#1D9E75` | `#1D9E75` | Thryve accent — **used sparingly** (small fills, underlines, micro-accents, CTAs) |
| `--green-soft` | `#9FE1CB` | `#9FE1CB` | accents on dark, chips |
| `--green-deep` | `#0F6E56` | `#0F6E56` | hover, nav, section headers |
| `--amber` | `#E8A020` | `#E8A020` | upsell + discount only |
| `--blue` | `#2F81F7` | `#2F81F7` | secondary CTA / tracking |
| `--red` | `#DA3633` | `#DA3633` | errors / strikethrough |

> Discipline: **green is punctuation, not paint.** Most of the page is ink-on-near-black with hairline rules.

### 5.3 Typography
- **Display:** *Space Grotesk* — weights 500–700, tight tracking (`-0.02em`), large editorial sizes.
- **Body / UI:** *Inter* — 400/500/600; 16px / 1.6.
- **Bengali:** *Hind Siliguri* (Regular/SemiBold) — separate stack, never for English.
- **Editorial accent (optional):** *Fraunces* serif — for big aspirational pull-quotes only ("become unstoppable.").
- **Scale (fluid):** Display `clamp(3rem,8vw,6.5rem)` · H1 `clamp(2.5rem,5vw,4rem)` · H2 `clamp(1.75rem,3vw,2.5rem)` · H3 `1.375rem` · body `1rem`.
- Loaded via `next/font` (Google) with preconnect; BN font conditionally when Bangla active.

### 5.4 Layout & spacing
- Editorial grid; **asymmetric** compositions where possible (not all-centered).
- Generous vertical rhythm: section padding `clamp(5rem,10vw,9rem)`. Container `max-width: 1240px` + side gutters.
- Hairline rules + ample negative "dark-space" over heavy borders/shadows. Shadows rare and soft.

### 5.5 Motion (calm, refined — *not* kinetic)
- **Framer Motion.** Fade/blur/slide-in on enter (~450–700ms, eased), subtle hero parallax, green marquee ticker, tasteful hover micro-interactions.
- **No** aggressive pin/scrub/stack (that's the cinematic lane we didn't pick).
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: all non-essential motion disabled; content always visible without JS.

### 5.6 Core components
Primary CTA (green fill, 44px min, 10px radius) · Secondary (green outline→fill on hover) ·
Product card (image 4:3, badges, title, price, rating, add-to-cart) · Category tile (image 16:9,
coming-soon overlay) · Trust chip · Badge (BESTSELLER/LAB TESTED/QR-AUTHENTICATED) ·
Review card (stars, name, city, verified) · Upsell widget (amber top border) · Payment method card ·
Language toggle pill · Subscription segmented control · Sticky WhatsApp bar · Mega-dropdown nav.

## 6. Information architecture (pages in scope)

**Full build (premium):**
1. `/` Home · 2. `/shop` Shop all · 3. `/creatine` Creatine · 4. `/accessories` Accessories ·
5. `/product/[slug]` Product detail · 6. `/cart` Cart · 7. `/checkout` Checkout (3-step) ·
8. `/order/[id]` Confirmation · 9. `/track` Track order · 10. `/verify` + `/verify/[serial]` QR verify ·
11. `/athletes` Athletes · 12. `/science` Science · 13. `/about` About · 14. `/blog` + `/blog/[slug]` Blog · 15. `/contact` Contact ·
16. `/stories` Thryver Stories · 17. `/resources` Resources

**Teaser / waitlist (coming-soon):** 18. `/pre-workout` (Katana) · 19. `/activewear` (new brand) · 20. `/whey` (2027)

**Global chrome:** sticky nav w/ mega-dropdown · footer · WhatsApp sticky bar · language toggle (EN/বাংলা) · search · exit-intent phone popup · cart drawer.

---

## 7. Technical architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router, RSC) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · react-i18next · Framer Motion · Zustand (+ persist for cart) · lucide-react icons · `next/image`.

**Folder structure (planned):**
```
/src
  /app              # routes (App Router): layout, page.tsx per route
  /components
     /ui            # primitives (Button, Chip, Badge, Input…)
     /layout        # Nav, Footer, WhatsAppBar, LangToggle, MegaMenu
     /sections      # homepage sections (Hero, Marquee, CategoryStrip…)
     /product       # ProductCard, Gallery, FlavourSelector, UpsellWidget…
     /checkout      # Checkout steps, PaymentCard, OrderSummary
  /data             # mock data: products.ts, athletes.ts, reviews.ts, blog.ts, categories.ts
  /lib              # api.ts (adapter), utils, format (BDT/phone), i18n.ts
  /store            # cart.ts, ui.ts (Zustand)
  /locales          # en.json, bn.json
  /styles           # globals.css, tokens.css
  /types            # shared TS types
```

**Data layer (D5):** `lib/api.ts` exposes typed functions (`getProducts`, `getProduct(slug)`,
`placeOrder`, `trackOrder(phone)`, `verifySerial(serial)`). Today they read `/data/*`; tomorrow
they call `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. **Components never import mock data directly.**

**i18n (D3):** react-i18next, `locales/en.json` + `locales/bn.json`. Toggle persisted in
`localStorage`, detected from browser/IP on first visit. Brand/product/science terms stay English
in both. BN covers: nav, hero, CTAs, trust chips, checkout, track order, order-status labels, footer.

**BD specifics:** BDT formatting with ৳; phone normalization (`880`→`01`); division/district/area
hierarchy; COD default in checkout; WhatsApp `wa.me` deep links with prefilled text.

**Performance / SEO / a11y:** Next SSR for product+blog; per-route metadata + OG; Product/
BreadcrumbList/Organization JSON-LD; `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt`; WebP/lazy images; Lighthouse 90+
mobile target; LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1; WCAG 2.1 AA (alt text, labels, 4.5:1 contrast, keyboard nav).

## 9. Execution log (chronological)

**2026-06-16 — Planning**
- Read full 18-page brief; extracted to `_brief_extract.txt` (working ref).
- Reviewed current thryvebd.com (single-product brochure) via reader.
- Ran research (2026 trends + brief's competitor analysis) → validated editorial+trust direction.
- Confirmed scope with client/builder: D1 front-end+mock data; D2 Refined & Editorial; D3 EN-first i18n.
- Created this log + design spec snapshot (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-thryve-website-design.md`).
- **Next:** approval to start Phase 0.

**2026-06-16 — Phase 0: Foundation ✅**
- Scaffolded Next.js 16.2.9 + React 19 + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript (App Router, `src/`) at repo root.
  - Note: scaffolded into a temp `thryve-web/` dir (npm rejects the spaced/capital folder name as a package name), then moved up to root. Package name stays `thryve-web` — does not need to match folder.
  - **Incident (resolved, no data loss):** during cleanup I ran `rm -rf thryve-web/.*`; the `.*` glob expanded to `..` and I briefly believed the project root had been wiped. In reality the shell's cwd was stuck inside `thryve-web`, so my `ls` was showing the empty leftover, not root. Root was fully intact the entire time. Removed the leftover via PowerShell. **Lesson logged: never use `rm -rf <dir>/.*`.**
- Installed deps: `i18next react-i18next framer-motion zustand lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge`.
- Built design-token system in `globals.css` (dark-first + light via `[data-theme]`, mapped into Tailwind v4 `@theme inline` → `bg-bg`/`text-ink`/`bg-green` utilities; marquee + hairline + noise utilities; reduced-motion safe).
- Fonts via `next/font`: Inter (body), Space Grotesk (display), Hind Siliguri (Bangla). *(Fraunces deferred; serif token falls back to Georgia for now.)*
- i18n: `src/i18n/client.ts` + `Providers` (react-i18next), `locales/en.json` + `locales/bn.json` (nav/hero/trust/common/footer + stats + marquee). SSR renders EN, switches to stored lang after mount (no hydration mismatch). `changeLanguage()` updates i18n + `<html lang/data-lang>` + localStorage.
- Data layer: `src/data/*` (site, categories, products, athletes, reviews, blog) + `src/lib/api.ts` adapter (sync + async accessors; mock verify/track). **Components never import mock data directly — they go through `api.ts` (D5).**
- State: `src/store/cart.ts` (Zustand + persist) and `src/store/ui.ts` (drawers/menus).
- Types: `src/types/index.ts`. Helpers: `lib/format.ts` (BDT/Bengali numerals, BD phone, dates, `tx()`), `lib/utils.ts` (`cn`).
- Created `public/product-placeholder.svg` (branded jar) for accessories without real photos yet.
- `next.config.ts`: remote image patterns (Cloudinary + Unsplash). `layout.tsx`: full metadata + theme-init script.
- **Verified:** `npm run build` → ✓ compiled, TypeScript passed, static pages generated.
- **Next:** Phase 1 — global chrome (nav + mega-dropdown, footer, WhatsApp bar, lang toggle, cart drawer) + real Home.

**2026-06-16 — Phase 1: Global chrome + Home ✅**
- UI primitives: `Button` (5 variants/sizes), `Container`, `Badge`, `Chip`, `Stars` (fractional overlay), `Price` (BDT + Bangla numerals + discount), `Logo` (T-mark + wordmark), `Reveal` (Framer, reduced-motion safe), `Marquee`.
- Global chrome: sticky `Navbar` (logo, 5 category links w/ CSS group-hover **mega-dropdown** — rich Creatine panel, Accessories, coming-soon teasers), `LanguageToggle`, `CartDrawer` (AnimatePresence slide-over, free-delivery progress, qty steppers), `MobileMenu`, `Footer` (link columns, newsletter, payments, social), `WhatsAppFab` (FAB w/ expand label + pulse), `useLang` helper.
- Home: `Hero` (asymmetric, parallax image, kinetic type, floating product/rating chips, trust chips), `MarqueeBar`, `CategoryStrip` (5 tiles, coming-soon overlays), `Bestsellers` (4-up incl. bundle last), `SocialProof` (3 stats), `AthletesStrip` (cards + codes + quotes), `BlogPreview` (3 posts), `QrVerifyCta` (serial input → /verify/[serial]).
- Wired all chrome into root `layout.tsx`; home is a server component composing client sections (SSR = EN for SEO).
- **Fixes:** lucide-react dropped brand icons → inline SVG social glyphs in footer; `Qrcode`→`QrCode` (this lucide version). Using `<img>` (not `next/image`) for now to avoid sharp/optimization friction — **convert to `next/image` in Phase 5**.
- **Verified:** `GET /` → **HTTP 200**, compiles clean.
- **Next:** Phase 2 — product detail (gallery, subscription toggle, flavour selector, qty/CTA, trust, upsell, tabs, reviews) + shop/category/cart pages.

**2026-06-16 — Phase 2: Product experience ✅**
- Product detail (`/product/[slug]`, server + `generateStaticParams`/metadata → client `ProductDetail`): `ProductGallery` (main + thumbs + hover zoom), badges, title/variant, rating, `Price`/subscription-price, **subscription toggle** (one-time vs Subscribe & Save 13%, live price), **flavour selector** (pills + low-stock), qty stepper + Add-to-Cart (opens drawer) + Buy Now, trust row, **upsell widget** (Frequently Bought Together, amber), payment chips, **content tabs** (About/Ingredients/How to use/Reviews/Lab certificate), `Reviews` (distribution + verified cards + show-more).
- `PageHeader`, `ShopBrowser` (category filter + sort), `Collection` (flavour filter) primitives.
- Pages: `/shop` (all products), `/creatine` (flavour-filtered), `/accessories` (grid), `/cart` (items + qty + upsell-ready summary + free-delivery nudge + empty state).
- **Verified:** `/product/creatine-monohydrate`, `/shop`, `/creatine`, `/accessories`, `/cart` all → **HTTP 200**.
- **Next:** Phase 3 — checkout, order confirmation, tracking, QR verify.

**2026-06-16 — Phase 3: Purchase + Trust ✅**
- `/checkout` — 3-step `CheckoutFlow` (client): **Step 1 Delivery** (name, BD phone w/ validation + normalize-on-blur, division→district cascading selects, area, address), **Step 2 Payment** (COD default+prominent, bKash expand w/ number, Nagad, SSLCommerz card), **Step 3 Review** (address/payment summary, athlete-promo code `TANVIR10` → 10% off, place order). Sticky order summary with free-delivery logic. Places a mock order → sessionStorage → `/order/[id]` + clears cart.
- `/order/[id]` — confirmation (reads sessionStorage): timeline (Preparing/Dispatch/Delivery), items, WhatsApp link, track CTA.
- `/track` — phone lookup (`trackByPhone` mock → last orders w/ status) + WhatsApp self-service option.
- `/verify` (input) + `/verify/[serial]` (server, `verifySerial` mock → Authentic ✓ / couldn't verify, batch/product).
- **Verified:** `/checkout`, `/track`, `/verify`, `/verify/[serial]` → **HTTP 200**.
- **Next:** Phase 4 — athletes, science, about, blog, contact, stories, resources + coming-soon teasers + exit-intent popup.

**2026-06-16 — Phase 4: Content + teasers ✅**
- Pages: `/athletes` (cards + codes + Shop-with-code), `/blog` (featured + grid) + `/blog/[slug]` (hero, per-post body, related product), `/about` (story + values + CTA), `/contact` (WhatsApp/email/address cards), `/science` (lab batches + explainers + QR verify), `/stories` (transformation cards), `/resources` (guide hub).
- Coming-soon: `ComingSoon` client component (badge/title/tagline/bullets + phone waitlist) → `/pre-workout` (Katana, Aug '26), `/activewear` (new brand), `/whey` (2027).
- `ExitIntent` popup (desktop mouseout-to-top + 60s mobile fallback, once/session, ৳150-off phone capture) wired into layout.
- **Verified:** all content/teaser routes → HTTP 200.

**2026-06-17 — Phase 5: Polish ✅**
- SEO: `sitemap.ts` (static + product + blog routes), `robots.ts`, JSON-LD `Organization` (layout) + `Product` (PDP), per-route metadata throughout.
- Custom `not-found.tsx` (404). Dark/light `ThemeToggle` (persists; no-FOUC via theme-init script) in navbar. `/account` sign-in stub.
- Fixed a prerender error (`/account` server component passed an `onSubmit` handler → removed).
- **Verified:** `npm run build` → ✓ compiled, TypeScript passed, **33 routes prerendered** (static + SSG product/blog + dynamic order/verify). Build exit 0.
- 🟢 **All 5 phases complete.** The site is a working, premium, bilingual (EN + বাংলা key surfaces) front-end on mock data — ready to drop onto Thryve OS (see §11).

**2026-06-17 — QA + refinement pass ✅**
- **Tested (programmatic):** crawled all 27 routes (200 for valid, custom 404 fires correctly); verified **every image URL resolves** (200, incl. previously-uncertain Unsplash IDs for whey/accessories/shaker); confirmed key content renders (hero, headings, product names); dev log clean (no runtime/hydration errors); headless-screenshotted home / product / checkout / mobile-home via Edge.
- **Fixed 6 real defects** found on review:
  1. Empty review stars were near-invisible (`text-line` on dark) → `text-ink-dim/25`.
  2. PDP **"Buy Now" was a dead link** (didn't add the item) → now adds to cart then routes to `/checkout`.
  3. Mega-menu **"Bundles" pointed at a non-existent route** (`/creatine/starter-stack`) → `/product/creatine-starter-stack`.
  4. **"View certificate" linked to a missing PDF** (404) → now `/science`.
  5. Floating hero chips could overflow on mobile → hidden below `sm`.
  6. Global `overflow-x: hidden` safety net added.
- **Re-verified:** `npm run build` → exit 0 (33 routes); all refined routes HTTP 200; no errors.
- **Note:** a separate AI image-review tool produced an unreliable report (hallucinated truncated text, wrong fonts, a fictitious empty footer) — disregarded; trusted concrete checks + code instead.

**2026-06-24 — Redesign kickoff: "Performance Editorial" (BeastLife blend) 🟡 Planning**
- **Trigger:** client likes [beastlife.in](https://beastlife.in/) → asked for a refactor blending BeastLife with Thryve's existing features + story-based features.
- Explored current state (site is complete + QA-passed, 33 routes, "Refined Editorial"); BeastLife was already a brief reference but the team had picked the editorial lane.
- Studied BeastLife's live homepage structure (utility nav, category icon strip, hero carousel, tabbed "Talk of the Town" product carousels, wellness, "Shop by Flavours", "Beast Stories" transformations, apparel, bundles, "Shop By Category", flip testimonials, "Beastgram" UGC, panther mascot).
- Ran a structured brainstorm (one decision at a time) → locked **R1–R6** (§4). Senior call: don't clone BeastLife's discount-dense look; take structure/energy, execute premium via **badge discipline**.
- Wrote new design spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-thryve-beastlife-blend-redesign.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-thryve-beastlife-blend-redesign.md) — direction, design system (adds `--volt` energy token), 17-section homepage, 3 story features, data-layer impact, phased propagation (R0–R5), scope/DoD.
- User approved the spec → wrote implementation plan (first milestone): [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-thryve-performance-editorial-r0-r1.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-thryve-performance-editorial-r0-r1.md) — covers **R0 (Foundation refresh)** + **R1 (Homepage rebuild)**, 15 tasks, complete no-placeholder code, build-gated per task (this project verifies via `npm run build`/lint/render — no unit-test runner). R2–R5 are follow-on plans.
- **Verification method note:** no test framework in this project; each task's gate = `npm run build` exit 0 (+ `npm run lint` clean + render check), matching §9's established QA.
- **Next:** choose execution mode (subagent-driven vs inline) and begin R0.

**2026-06-24 — Phase R0+R1: implemented ✅ (Performance Editorial foundation + homepage)**
- Executed plan [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-thryve-performance-editorial-r0-r1.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-thryve-performance-editorial-r0-r1.md) inline (user chose to drive git manually; one commit at end). Branch: `redesign/performance-editorial` (baseline docs commit `c5b8d42`).
- **R0 Foundation:** `--volt` energy token (theme-aware) in `globals.css`; badge discipline (`save` kind + quiet `sale` + `DiscountChip`); 6 new story data modules (`goals`, `brand-story`, `trust-journey`, `transformations`, `ugc`, `flavours`) + new types + `lib/api.ts` accessors (`getGoalsSync`, `getBrandStorySync`, `getTrustJourneySync`, `getTransformationsSync`, `getUgcSync`, `getFlavoursSync`, `getBundlesSync`, `getProductsBySlugsSync`); new primitives `Stepper`, `ProductCarousel` (tabbed); new sections `CategoryTileStrip`, `FlavourPicker`, `StackCarousel`, `GoalJourney`, `BrandStory`, `TrustJourney`, `TransformationStrip`, `UgcGrid`, `BestsellerCarousel`; `TopUtilityBar` wired into `layout.tsx`.
- **R1 Homepage:** refreshed `Hero` (volt glow accent, athletic `clamp(3rem,9vw,7rem)` display, "Fuel the grind. / Thryve more." tagline); `page.tsx` now composes the 17-section stack (QrVerifyCta retired on home → replaced by TrustJourney).
- **Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0; `npm run build` exit 0 (**33 routes prerendered**, `/` static); `npm run lint` — **new/changed files have 0 errors** (only expected `<img>` warnings matching codebase convention).
- **Known, out-of-scope (NOT introduced here):** 7 pre-existing lint errors in untouched pages — `about/page.tsx`, `order/[id]/page.tsx`, `resources/page.tsx`, `checkout-flow.tsx`, `theme-toggle.tsx` (unescaped apostrophes + 2× setState-in-effect). **Fix in R3/R4.**
- **Defer to R5:** convert `<img>` → `next/image` across new + existing sections.
- **Next:** user commits; then write the R2 (commerce propagation) follow-on plan.

**2026-06-24 — R0+R1 committed + R2 plan written**
- R0+R1 committed: **`d07813a`** on `redesign/performance-editorial` (28 files, +1035/−29), build green, homepage visually verified via headless Chrome screenshot (desktop + mobile). Scratch (`.superpowers/`) gitignored.
- **R2 plan written:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-thryve-performance-editorial-r2.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-thryve-performance-editorial-r2.md) — 5 tasks: (1) `Price` discount chip red→amber [badge discipline, propagates to all cards], (2) PDP trust-journey block + amber savings, (3) `/shop` featured BestsellerCarousel, (4) cart volt free-delivery progress bar, (5) delete dead `QrVerifyCta`/`CategoryStrip`/`Bestsellers`. **Reasoned deviation:** keep filterable grids on `/creatine`+`/accessories` (better UX than carousels; they inherit the card fixes) — carousel only on `/shop` as a featured row.
- **Next:** execute R2.

**2026-06-24 — Phase R2: executed ✅ (commerce propagation)**
- Executed R2 plan inline (same pattern: build-gated, one commit at end). 5 tasks:
  1. `Price` discount chip red→amber — badge discipline now applies to **every** product card + PDP (highest-leverage fix).
  2. PDP: amber subscription savings chip + a compact "Why your jar is real" trust-journey `Stepper` block (Source→Lab→Jar→QR) above the content tabs.
  3. `/shop`: featured `BestsellerCarousel` ("Talk of the town") row above the filterable grid.
  4. `/cart`: volt free-delivery progress bar + "unlocked free delivery" state.
  5. Deleted dead `QrVerifyCta`, `CategoryStrip`, `Bestsellers` (verified zero imports → rm → build green).
- **Verified:** `npm run build` exit 0 (33 routes); `npm run lint` — 7 pre-existing errors only (unchanged), **R2 files clean**, warnings 23→22. `/creatine` + `/accessories` inherit the card fix automatically (grids kept by design).
- **Next:** write + execute R3 (content + stories: `/stories`, `/about`, `/science`, `/athletes`, `/blog`, `/resources`, teasers, `/track`, `/verify` — incl. fixing the 7 pre-existing lint errors in `about`/`order`/`resources`).

## 10. Open questions & risks

- **Client assets** (logo vector, real product/athlete photos, lab-certificate PDFs, final copy/prices/flavours) — currently assumed unavailable → using stock + generated jar mockup. **Action:** request from client; slots ready in `/public` + data layer.
- **Bengali copy review** — builder generates BN; client should review before launch.
- **Back-end integration timing** — when Thryve OS endpoints are live, swap `lib/api.ts` base + add auth. No UI changes expected.
- **Payment gateways** — out of scope now (mocked); integrate bKash/Nagad/SSLCommerz with the back-end team later.
- **Performance with stock imagery** — must optimise/compress; consider BunnyCDN later (brief's existing setup).

## 11. Handoff notes (for future builders)

1. This is a **front-end-only** build on **mock data**. The real system = Thryve OS back-end (separate team).
2. **To connect the real API:** edit `src/lib/api.ts` — switch the data source from `/data/*` to `fetch(NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL + ...)`. Components won't change (D5).
3. **To add full Bangla:** complete `src/locales/bn.json`; the toggle + fonts already work (D3).
4. **Design intent:** *Refined Editorial* — calm, airy, green-as-punctuation, trust shown visibly. Resist requests to make it "louder" — that regresses to the cheap-local-copy look the client wants to avoid (see D2, §5).
5. **Read this log's §4 + §5 before changing design/system decisions.** Log any new decision in §4 + §9.
